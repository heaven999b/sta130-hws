    "1. P-value Explanation:\n",
    "The p-value we calculated is 0.0222, whichless than the significance level (α=0.05.A p-value of 0.0222 means that, assuming the null hypothesis is true (that the students are just guessing and have a 50% chance of being correct), the probability of observing a result as extreme as 49 correct identifications out of 80 students is only 2.22%. This is a very low probability, which provides strong evidence against the null\n",
    "Since the p-value is lower than 0.05, we conclude that the observed result is statistically significant and unlikely to have occurred by random guessing alone. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "The 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of students who can correctly identify whether milk or tea was poured first is calculated to be (0.5079, 0.7171).\n",

    "Why this matters:above 0.5, meaning\n",
    "Since the confidence interval excludes 0.5, it supports our decision to reject the null"
